Happy Birthday, Shreya ‚ù§Ô∏è

I wish more than anything that I could be with you today. It hurts that I can‚Äôt be there to hold your hand, see your smile, and celebrate this special day together. I‚Äôm truly sorry for that.

Even though I‚Äôm not there in person, my heart is with you every moment. You've been my biggest support, my best friend, and the love of my life for 8 beautiful years. And still, every day, I find new reasons to love you even more.

Thank you for being by my side, for loving me endlessly, and for making life so full of meaning. You are the most important person in my life, and I love you more than words can ever fully express.

I hope today brings you happiness, love, and everything your heart wishes for. And I promise, we‚Äôll make up for this day soon ‚Äî together.

I love you so much, Shreya. Always and forever.

‚Äî Yours only,
Arnab
